  abstract = {The paper includes the study of the capacitive sensing technology and its applications in modern technology. The subject describes the behavior of electric field induced due to a capacitor. Capacitors are the basic building blocks of the electronic world. Capacitance is the ability of a capacitor to store an electrical charge. The sense of touch is an important human sensory channel. During interaction with physical objects, pets and human beings, touch (physical contact) constitutes an extremely significant event. The technology used to respond to such a physical touch is termed as capacitive sensing. In this paper we are going to define the capacitive sensing technology in the production of new age devices. Such device uses the human body capacitance as their input and according to the sensory feedback they provide output. These devices have a major role in the current scenario. Such devices are used to overcome accidents, which are a major cause in the present time. In this paper we are also going to define the use of such technology to design such king of helmet that can reduce the percentage of road accidents. When the driver wears that helmet then only his/her vehicle will be activated. This helmet uses the capacitance of the human ear as input. Now a days capacitive sensing has many applications, as such it is used in the smart phones used widely in the whole world. Many types of sensors use this technique. The major applications include the sensors used to measure or detect proximity, position or displacement, humidity, fluid level \& acceleration. Capacitive sensing is different from that of the inductive sensing and its main advantage is that it can sense different kind of materials like skin, plastic, metal \& liquid.},

  abstract = {Capacitive sensing is becoming a popular technology to replace optical detection methods and mechanical designs for applications like proximity/gesture detection, material analysis, and liquid level sensing. The main advantages that capacitive sensing has over other detection approaches are that it can sense different kinds of materials (skin, plastic, metal, liquid), it is contactless and wear-free, it has the ability to sense up to a large distance with small sensor sizes, the PCB sensor is low cost, and it is a lowpower solution. To understand what kind of applications and the constraints surrounding a system-level design entails, it is important to understand the theory of electrostatics and capacitance calculations. This application note covers the basics of the parallel plate and fringing effect, capacitive sensor design, and ways to adapt the capacitance sensing system within various applications.},
